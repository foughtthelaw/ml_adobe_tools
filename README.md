# ml_adobe_tools
A collection of miscellaneous tools used in video production with Adobe Creative Cloud apps. The main difference between this and [kbar_snippets](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/kbar_snippets) is that these have their own UI.

## AE
### Script UI
#### [Mogrt Tools](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/ml_adobe_tools/blob/main/ae/script_ui/ml_mogrtTools.jsxbin)
I started making lots of `.mogrt` flies around the same time I started trying to get serious about learning to write scripts for After Effects.

#### [Lots o' Comps](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/ml_adobe_tools/blob/main/ae/script_ui/ml_LotsOComps.jsxbin)
For when the producer in your life emails you a list of deliverable sizes and you'd rather just copy and paste the details.

### Expression Libraries
#### [responsive_layout.jsx](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/ml_adobe_tools/blob/main/ae/exp_lib/responsive_layout.jsx)
Functions for a responsive layout workflow using Master Properties.

#### [library_boilerplate.jsx](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/ml_adobe_tools/blob/main/ae/exp_lib/library_boilerplate.jsx)
The absolute bare bones minimum to get a working jsx library in after effects.


<!-- ##PR
####PR Tools
Premiere Pro is obnoxcious in that there's no ScriptUI support and the only way to run ExtendScript these days is via a CEP panel. As such, there's only 1 panel herebut I keep jamming more functionality into it as the need arises or when I want to learn something new. -->
