# ml_adobe_tools
A collection of miscellaneous tools used in video production with Adobe Creative Cloud apps. The main difference between this and [kbar_snippets](https://github.com/foughtthelaw/kbar_snippets) is that these have their own UI.

### Mogrt Tools
I started making lots of `.mogrt` flies around the same time I started trying to get serious about learning to write scripts for After Effects.

### Lots o' Comps
For when the producer in your life emails you a list of deliverable sizes and you'd rather just copy and paste the details.

<!-- ##PR
###PR Tools
Premiere Pro is obnoxcious in that there's no ScriptUI support and the only way to run ExtendScript these days is via a CEP panel. As such, there's only 1 panel herebut I keep jamming more functionality into it as the need arises or when I want to learn something new. -->
